# Javascript
my js journey
Hi there! I've been adding some exercises that I come across as well as some projects here.
Hoping to share experience and get some constructive feedback from developers. 
All the hints would be greatly appreciated, and hopefully reciprocated in the future :)
Good luck and have fun in programming!
